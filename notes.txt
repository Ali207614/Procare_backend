PATCH `/api/v1/repair-orders/:id/client` returns 500 error because it tries to update `repair_orders` table with client fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`, `email`) which should be in `users` table. Also `email` column is missing in the database.

GET `/api/v1/rental-phone-devices/` returns 500 error because the `rental_phone_devices` table in the database is missing many columns expected by the code (`serial_number`, `color`, `storage_capacity`, `deposit_amount`, `condition`, `specifications`). *Correction: `brand`, `model`, `imei`, `daily_rent_price`, `status`, `quantity`, `quantity_available` exist in the DB but are missing from the base migration.*
POST `/api/v1/rental-phone-devices/` also returns 500 error for the same reason. The database table `rental_phone_devices` is missing several columns, which are present in the POST payload and expected by the `create` method in `RentalPhoneDevicesService`.
PUT `/api/v1/rental-phone-devices/:id` partially fails or returns 500 error if key fields like `condition` are included in the payload, because the `rental_phone_devices` table is missing `condition`, `serial_number`, `color`, `storage_capacity`, `deposit_amount`, and `specifications` columns. However, updating fields that *do* exist (like `daily_rent_price`, `name`, `status`) should work if the conflicting columns are omitted from the payload.
